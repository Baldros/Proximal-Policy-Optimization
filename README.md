# Presentation:
This repository contains the code related to the RL project for implementing PPO based on the [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master) project.

# Repository Organization:
Each folder corresponds to a different implementation. The first folder maintains the original code's functionality, focusing on organizing the model's implementation in a more functional way. The second implementation uses only essential dependencies, aiming to simplify the dependency versioning process.
